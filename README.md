## Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website serves as a showcase of my professional journey, skills, and projects. It has been developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization.

As a passionate developer, I believe in continuous learning and growth. This portfolio is a reflection of my work, dedication, and enthusiasm for creating impactful applications.

## Features

- **Home Section:** A brief introduction about myself, highlighting key skills and achievements.
- **Projects:** Displaying a collection of my most significant projects with descriptions and links to their repositories or live demos.
- **Skills:** Showcasing my technical skills and proficiency level in each of them.
- **Experience:** Presenting my work experiences, internships, or any relevant professional engagements.
- **Contact:** A way for visitors to get in touch with me, either through a contact form or links to social media profiles.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the portfolio looks great and functions well on various devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop, thanks to Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

To run this portfolio website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd portfolio`.
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.

## Usage

After the installation process is complete, you can use the following npm scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server and opens the portfolio in your default web browser.

Customize the content, images, and colors as per your personal branding by modifying the appropriate components in the codebase. Tailwind CSS makes it easy to adjust the styling without touching the actual CSS files.

2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
3. Set up the deployment settings (e.g., custom domain, build configurations).
4. Push changes to your GitHub repository, and Vercel will automatically trigger the deployment process.
